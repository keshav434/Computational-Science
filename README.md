# Computational-Science
In this project, we use modelling to analyse cellular automation which is one of the major approaches to computational science principles. Cellular automation is a type of computer simulation that is a dynamic computational model and is discrete in space, state, and time. We even simulate the growth of tumour cells using the Gompertz model
